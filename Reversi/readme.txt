Hello!

The assignment was pretty challenging i had trouble in a few areas that got me stuck for a while
but i managed to fix them, i've tested the game quite a lot and i am not sure if i fixed everything in the 
game yet. But when i played it during my testing it works just fine.

This is my third time submitting this since i noticed some errors/bugs, hopfully this fixes them.
I admit that there was probably a better/easier way to do the validation of the tokens but this is all i could
think of right now.
